# Craftworks Task Manager

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development process

I started off by creating the repo an creating the folder structure and components and type definitions, after that I started to implement the basic functionality.

After I was happy with the basics I started developing the UI, while refactoring the existing components i also tested all functionality and refactored some of the component to also improove the feel of the application.

Touching the components over and over gave me time to refactor the logic and and structur of the app.

There is still a lot of headroom to improve functionality wise (pagination, docker). I updated the state managenemt to a more robust solution and added a few more features like the ability to add, edit and delete a tasks. I have issues with the edit functionality, I was not able to get it to work properly, I think it has to do with the way I am updating the state.

## Design

Looking at https://www.craftworks.ai/ made me think about creating a super clean and minimalist application with only tiny accents.
Using mostly Materials integrated components made development fast and easy.
